This is a pretty simple little bit of code written for class. It has to satisfy
three requirements:

1. Access twitter and post a tweet from the python command prompt.
2. Pick a famous person and obtain the last 100 of their tweets and display
them.
3. Extract all the hash tags in those tweets.

It uses the [python-twitter][tw-module] module for API access, and there's a
`requirements.txt` file for use with [`pip`][pip], like so

    pip install -r requirements.txt
